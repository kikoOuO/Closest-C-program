# Closest-C-program
A multi-process implementation of the Closest Parit of Points: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closest_pair_of_points_problem
Given a set of n points (where n is at least 2), find the closest pair of points in the set. Distance is measured using Euclidean distance. For points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2).

Where the input file should be an binary file consist of multiple points, and the program will solve the problem by using recursive Divide-and-Conquer Approach:
